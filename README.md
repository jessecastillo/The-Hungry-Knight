## Description

This program gives an immersive experience as the user is staying at an inn for the night as a knight, and will calculate the total cost of the stay.


---

## How To Use

To use this program, you can run it inside many text editor debuggers such as Sublime Text/Notepad++ if you would prefer to not create a new solution in Visual Studio Code. Once started, you may add your name to the innkeeper's book after his initial greeting. Input the values for each food item you would like your knight to consume. The costs will be calculated by the program, and the grand total, after taxes, will be printed out.
